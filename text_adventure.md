# Text Adventure

The floor is cold, it smells of of dead animal, and the sound of water drips in
the distance. You're in a cavern inside Echo Mountain delivering a battery to
the "tech spirit" so it can survive another year. You look around the room to
see a trapdoor, a computer, and a pretty damn big cockroach.

[Type "help" if you are not sure what to do next!]

## Look / Inspect

- trapdoor: there's a rusty old trapdoor, doesn't look like it's been used in
at least a year. maybe you can pull it open?
- wall / walls: they're pretty standard looking walls. unless you've got x-ray goggles it's probably pretty pointless looking here.
- computer: there's some just-started-my-adventure looking dude using the computer right now, it's probably you, let's steer clear of inception and stay away from him.
- cockroach: it's a pretty big cockroach. if you weren't some masochistic adventurer you'd definitely be jumping up on the table right about now. it seems to be alive, but doesn't seem to be moving at the moment.
- panel: hey! how did you know that was here... stop cheating.

## Pull / Pick up
- trapdoor: you pull it open, it's heavy but you think it's quite weird there's
  no lock which you had to find a key for. there's something inside.
  - then if you `look trapdoor`: there's some weird looking technological
    goggle things. you put them on, something starts whirring. the world looks
    a bit different...
  - then if you `look`. You look around the world and see well... a lot of things. these might just be x-ray goggles. you can see the trapdoor you just opened, the circuitry of the computer, the innards of the cockroach (is there something else inside it?, is that why it hasn't moved)  and the outlines of the walls to the room. you can see where you entered, but you can also see the outlines of a hidden panel on the south side of the room.
- cockroach: you may be a masochistic adventurer, but there's no way you're picking up that cockroach without a good reason to. things the biggest you've ever seen.
