# TODO

In order to finish this project I need to:

1. [ ] Properly clean up textures
  - Properly dispose of components and shit
2. [x] Properly separate Sprite/Sprisheet into components
3. [ ] Debug weird frame dropping
  - Should probably use pointers for RenderJobs
    - This didn't fix anything
    - Maybe just having so many draw calls isn't that great for WebGL?
4. [ ] Normalize coordinates system (store as floats and have dynamic scale)
5. [ ] Change maze to only have one task chamber.
6. [ ] Create text adventure
7. [ ] Create final boss room
